# Demo of MobiScroll Listview Issue

I've scaffolded the app with create-react-app, and I've added two mobiscroll listview components onto the page.  To save time, I have copied the bits of code which are being used from our repository.

The only difference between these two listview components is that the top one includes stages -- which is the swipe-to-delete functionality -- whereas the bottom one does not.  You will notice the difference when you try dragging.

To run demo:

> npm run start
